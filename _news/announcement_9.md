Between the 01/11 to 07/11, I was at IEEE VIS in Vienna, for organizing the [Input visualization workshop](https://inputvisualization.github.io/vis2025/) and for participating to the panel discussion about [Otto Neurath - "Words divide, pictures unite" - Revisiting Otto Neurath's Isotype at 100](https://sites.google.com/view/isotype/panel-discussion). Also Anne Flore Cabouat was presenting [Bridging Educational Theories of Cognitive Load to Visualization Design and Evaluation](https://telecom-paris.hal.science/I3-TPT/hal-05218370v1) and June Bhartia was presenting Exploring Touch Interactions for Input Visualization in Personal Informatics.
