I will be at [ACM CHI 2026](https://chi2026.acm.org/) in Barcelona, we are organizing a workshop on [Craft-Based Data Physicalization: Opportunities and Challenges](https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/craftphysicalization/). 
Please submit your project on the website if you are creating physicalization. 
This in-person, three-hour workshop brings participants together to create, discuss, and reflect on crafting as a data practice; authoring processes and materiality; aesthetic–analytical tensions; and systems that support data craft.
