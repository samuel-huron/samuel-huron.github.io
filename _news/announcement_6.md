I have the pleasure to co-organise the ACM ISS workshop on [*Visual Methods and Analyzing Visual Data in Human Computer Interaction*](https://summit.sfu.ca/_flysystem/fedora/2024-08/ISS24_workshop_zezhong.pdf). 
The workshop will take place in Vancouver Canada but remote attendance are allowed ! If you are interested join us.
