My research focus on Interaction Design, Human Computer Interaction, Physical representation of data. 
In particular I am investigating question such as how human create representation of data, how can we study negative impact of digital technology before they occurs, and how we can make digital technology more sustainable.
Lately I co-edited the book _"[Making with Data: Physical Design and Craft in a Data-Driven World](https://makingwithdata.org/)"_ with Till Nagel, Lora Oehlberg, Wesley Willett. 

I am an alumni of I Lab of the University of Calgary and the Innovis Lab, the ENSAD Lab, INRIA, Université Paris Sud, Université Panthéon Sorbonne, Université Paris 8, and the CRI. I worked as the lead design of the research institute of the Pompidou Center (IRI). And in multiple digital communication agency between 1999 and 2010. I designed, developped, and supervise hundreds of interactive media projects where I worked with a broad range of civic, cultural and corporate clients. Before doing research, I was engage as a new media artist where I collaborated with video art label on art installation, video mixing and live performances. I presented and performed some of our art work in different show or exhibition including art museums, parties, and festivals.

For my Ph.D. on Constructive Visualization I was awarded "Best doctoral dissertation award" from IEEE VGTC Pioneer Group.
