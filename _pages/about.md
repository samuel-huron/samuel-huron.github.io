I am an interaction designer and computer scientist; my research focuses on new media, Interaction Design, Human-Computer Interaction, physical representation of data, and social computing. 
In particular, I am investigating how humans create representations of data, how we can study digital technology's negative impact before it occurs, and how we can make digital technology more sustainable.
I recently co-edited the book "[Making with Data: Physical Design and Craft in a Data-Driven World](https://makingwithdata.org/)" with Till Nagel, Lora Oehlberg, and Wesley Willett. 

On the research side, I am co-chair of the Axis "[Theory, practice, and politics of design and creative action](https://i3.cnrs.fr/axes-de-recherche/theorie-et-modeles-de-la-conception/)" of the i3 CNRS Lab with Pascal Lemasson and co-chair of the Design seminar for the PEPR ICCAR. On the teaching side, I am also co-heading the Master program Design Recherche with ENS, ENSCI, and Télécom and the Executive Education Mastère program on Innovation and entrepreneurship in collaboration with Zhejiang University, Polytechnique, ENSTA, and Télécom. 

My academic journey includes a postdoctoral fellowship at the I Lab in the Innovis group under the supervision of [Sheelagh Caprendale](http://sheelaghcarpendale.ca/) at the University of Calgary. Prior to that, I pursued my PhD in the [Aviz](https://www.aviz.fr/) group at [INRIA Saclay](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-saclay), completing it with the Université Paris Sud under the guidance of Jean-Daniel Fekete and in collaboration with the [research institute of the Pompidou Center](https://www.iri.centrepompidou.fr/) (IRI). My Ph.D. in Constructive Visualization was recognized with the '[Best Doctoral Dissertation Award](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/awards/vis-doctoral-dissertation-award/)' from IEEE VGTC Pioneer Group. During my Ph.D. I also served as the lead design of the Research Institute of the Pompidou Center (IRI). 

I have a deep passion for interdisciplinary work, which is reflected in my academic journey. Before my Ph.D., I received a Master of Fine Art in New Media from the Université Panthéon Sorbonne under the supervision of Anne Marie Duguet. I also received a Master 1 in Information and Communication Sciences from the Université Paris 8, based on my industrial work, and studied Philosophy and Psychology in my first years of bachelor at the Université Paris 8. I also had the opportunity to work with the group's Image Temps Reel and Extension du Reel at ENSAD Lab. I co-founded the hackerspace Fabelier and followed the Web Science Master at the CRI. 

Before my academic career, between 1999 and 2010, I had an industrial career as a designer in multiple digital communication agencies. I designed, developed, and supervised hundreds of interactive media projects where I worked with a broad range of civic, cultural, and corporate clients. At that time, I was engaged as a new media artist, collaborating with a video art label on an art installation, video mixing, and live performances. I presented and performed some of our artwork in different shows or exhibitions, including art museums, parties, and festivals.
