* ANR - [Collaborative Continuity from Digital to Human](https://anr.fr/ProjetIA-21-ESRE-0030) - The CONTINUUM project is a collaborative research infrastructure of 30 platforms located throughout France, to advance interdisciplinary research based on interaction between computer science and the human and social sciences. Among CONTINUUM, 37 research teams develop cutting-edge research programs focusing on visualization, immersion, interaction and collaboration, as well as on human perception, cognition and behaviour in virtual/augmented reality, with potential impact on societal issues. The infrastructure empowers scientists, engineers and industry users with a highly interconnected network of high-performance visualization and immersive platforms to observe, manipulate, understand and share digital data, real-time multi-scale simulations, and virtual or augmented experiences. This project is funding the observation lab and the design studio. 
* PEPR - [Ensemble](https://www.pepr-ensemble.fr/) - The digital collaboration research programme (also known as PEPR eNSEMBLE) is a national research programme funded by France 2030, which brings together scientists from all disciplines to address current issues in digital collaboration. This is funding the post doc of Toi-Sin Arvidson.
