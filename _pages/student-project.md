## Visual Analytics for Comparative Eye-Tracking Analysis
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a visual analytic system to explore and compare eye-tracking scanpaths. 
The goal is to support the analysis of visual behavior across different experimental conditions, tasks, and visualization idioms. 
The system will enable interactive exploration of fixations, saccades, and scanpaths, and provide comparative views that reveal similarities, differences, and strategies in visual attention. 
The project will be informed by prior work in eye-tracking analysis and information visualization, and may rely on existing datasets or small experimental studies.

### Required Skills

* Programming skills (e.g., Python, JavaScript, or similar),
* Interest in data visualization, HCI, or visual analytics,
* Basic knowledge of experimental methods or eye-tracking data is a plus, but not required.

### Expected Outcomes
* A functional visual analytics prototype for scanpath comparison,
* A documented design rationale grounded in related literature,
* A final report describing the system, design choices, and example analyses,
* ((Optional) A short paper or poster suitable for an academic venue.
