Critical User Experiences - (HSS_5ID30_TP)

Over the last century, engineers, researchers, and designers have worked to develop visions, products, and services that make digital technologies accessible to a broad public. We benefit from these decades of technological development in our everyday lives by using computational tools to think, communicate, exchange, and work in both private and public contexts. The process of centering design around the needs and experiences of individual and collective users has proven effective in producing usable and impactful digital systems.

However, we increasingly observe that many industrial actors design digital technologies not to prioritize the interests of their users, but rather those of other stakeholders. At the same time, the large-scale deployment of digital technologies has generated significant ethical, legal, moral, and societal challenges. While digital technologies have been among the most powerful accelerators of human connection and access to knowledge, they have also become major disruptors of contemporary societies.

These disruptions include the use of deceptive design practices and dark patterns; the manipulation of democratic processes through social networks; the proliferation and interdependence of digital services; the environmental impact of digital infrastructures; the transformation of labor (e.g., platform-based work, uberization, and microtasks); and the increasing surveillance by both public and private actors, alongside the large-scale capture of personal data.

The Critical User Experience course seeks to address and analyze these issues from multiple perspectives, including design, sociology, and ethnography. The course is structured as a series of lectures and invited talks focused on contemporary challenges in digital design.

Prior to each lecture, students are invited to identify issues and power imbalances in their own user experiences or in current media. During the lectures, they engage in discussions with invited speakers. Afterward, students are asked to generate and sketch provocative concepts (provotypes) or to explore potential solutions through prototyping. During the final two weeks of the course, students further develop one selected prototype or provotype in preparation for a public presentation and user testing. The course concludes with an exhibition showcasing the resulting prototypes and provotypes.
