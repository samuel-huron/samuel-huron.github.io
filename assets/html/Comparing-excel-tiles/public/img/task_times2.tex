\caption{Minimum, maximum, and average time it takes to complete the building and editing subtasks of the authoring portion in each condition. Total time is considered the summation of a participant's building and editing/verification phases. Note that in the max and min rows, the total time of the authoring task is not the summation of the subtasks, as each value is computed individually from the minimum and maximum times of all participants. The average time for the authoring task in the tiles condidition is the summation of the building and editing subtasks. In the Excel condition, four participants combined their building and editing subtasks together, and thus they have no recorded time in the editing subtask portion, skewing the average time for completing the Excel task sligtly.}
