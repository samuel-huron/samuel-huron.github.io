\caption{Minimum, maximum, and average time it takes to complete part of a task in each condition. Total time is considered the summation of a participant's authoring and verification phases, along with coloring in Excel. Note that in the max and min rows, total time does not directly correspond to the sum of the verification and authoring columns, as these values are independently taken from the minimum and maximum times of all participants.}
