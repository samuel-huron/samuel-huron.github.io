It is my great pleasure to invite you to my public presentation for the Habilitation à diriger des recherches (HDR).
It will take place in English (with a strong frencg accent) on 3 December at 2 p.m. at Télécom Paris (the lecture room will be the Amphi Thevenin, or if it's change it will be posted at the reception desk) and on [Zoom](https://telecom-paris.zoom.us/j/98092512156?pwd=AfyrTyn7BMaDc1VPPo6FyNxyUL7W5b.1).

Please register here if you wish to attend physically: [https://evento.renater.fr/survey/samuel-huron-hdr-05ssscsq](https://evento.renater.fr/survey/samuel-huron-hdr-05ssscsq)

## Jury 
The jury will be composed of:

* Céline Coutrix, CNRS Researcher, University of Grenoble Alpes.
* Annie Gentes, Professor, Director of Research, CY School of Design
* Lucy Kimbell, Professor of Contemporary Design Practices, Central Saint Martins,
* Wendy Elizabeth Mackay, Research Director, INRIA, University of Paris Saclay
* Miriah Meyer, Professor, Linköpings Universitet


## Abstract  

The manuscript is entitled ``**Data Representation, Output to Input**''.

I have spent the last ten years exploring how humans can construct data representations that are accessible to all and low-cost, using various means such as sketching on paper or building with physical tokens. I compared these to digital tools and reflected on how they differ and complement each other. I then became interested in how experts from different fields (art, design, research) construct and produce physical representations of data. Finally, I studied with my doctoral students the use of data representations in the fields of energy feedback devices and online debate platforms.

These diverse works led me to question the relationship between data and its representations in the digital world.

With the tools mentioned above, humans produce data by creating their own representations and adding data to them. However, in the community of visualisation and human-machine interactions, for the past 20 or 30 years, there has been a clear distinction between visualisations intended to represent *existing* data and graphical interfaces that allow data to be captured, manipulated, and represented.

My co-authors and I explored this dilemma within a design space that allowed us to define and show how data visualisations can also be a means of collecting and modifying data for various purposes, such as: individual reflection, public collective reflection, documentation of public activities, discussion of data, investigation, planning, and collective organisation. This new paradigm for visualisations opens up a vast, underexplored field of research. 

To conclude this presentation, I will attempt to offer a practical and critical reflection on the different methods I have used over the past ten years: qualitative visual data analysis and design spaces.  Finally, if I have time, I would like to offer a provocative question: why, over the last 30 years, has the field of data visualisation given little or no consideration to the issue of input in data visualisations?
